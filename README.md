##### Troubles with the app

If the app does not work correctly click the "Help" link in the navigation bar at the top and you will be directed to a contact page.

- Things to consider before asking for help:
 	- Does the device have internet?
  		- Some parts of the app need the web to function correctly.
 	- Did you follow the prompts to get to the training section needed?
 	- Have your tried more that one time?
  		- Sometimes the state of the app needs to update but an action is taken before it is finish a process ( This is a known ***BUG*** and will be fixed in the next release)
